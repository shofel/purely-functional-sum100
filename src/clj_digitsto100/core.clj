;;; Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put a + or â€“ or
;;; nothing between the numbers 1-9 (in order) such that the result
;;; is 100. For example:
;;;
;;; 1 + 2 + 34 - 5 + 67 - 8 + 9 = 100
;;;
;;; The function should output a list of strings with these formulas.

;;; Let's make it as the last step.

;; What is the output?
;;   - a list of all decisions taken?
;;   - a list of digits and signs between them?

;; The first option will require merging back with digits.

;; of an element.
